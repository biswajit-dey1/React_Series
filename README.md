# üåì React Theme Switcher

A sleek and modern React application demonstrating a robust theme switching mechanism using React Context API and Tailwind CSS for dynamic styling. This project offers a seamless user experience with real-time theme updates and responsive design.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Seamless Theme Switching:** Toggle between light and dark modes instantly.
* **Context-based State Management:** Utilizes React's Context API for efficient and global theme state management.
* **Tailwind CSS Dark Mode:** Leverages Tailwind CSS's `dark:` variant for effortless theme-aware styling.
* **Reusable Components:**
    * **Theme Toggle Button (`ThemeBtn`):** Provides an intuitive UI for theme control.
    * **Product Card (`Card`):** A dynamically styled component showcasing theme-aware elements like product image, title, rating, price, and an "Add to cart" button.
* **HTML Class Manipulation:** Dynamically adds/removes `dark` class on the `<html>` element for global theme activation.
* **Clean and Responsive UI:** Crafted with Tailwind CSS for a modern and adaptable design.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **React.js:** For building the user interface.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling, including built-in dark mode support.
* **React Context API:** For global state management of the theme.

## üìÅ Project Structure

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Theme Implementation Works

The core of the theme switching functionality is built around these principles:

1.  **`ThemeContext` Definition (`context/theme.js`):**
    A `ThemeContext` is created with `createContext`, providing `themeMode` state (defaulting to "light") and functions (`darkTheme`, `lightTheme`) to update this state.

    ```javascript
    export const ThemeContext = createContext({
        themeMode: "light",
        darkTheme: () => {},
        lightTheme: () => {}
    });
    ```

2.  **`ThemeContext.Provider` (`App.jsx`):**
    The entire application is wrapped within `ThemeContext.Provider`. The `value` prop of the provider supplies the current `themeMode` and the `darkTheme`/`lightTheme` functions to all descendant components.

3.  **Theme State Management (`App.jsx`):**
    `App.jsx` maintains the `themeMode` state using `useState`. It also contains the logic to update this state and to manipulate the `class` attribute of the `<html>` element based on the `themeMode`. When `themeMode` is "dark", the `dark` class is added to `<html>`, activating Tailwind's dark mode.

4.  **`ThemeBtn` Component (`components/ThemeBtn.jsx`):**
    This component consumes the `ThemeContext` to access the `themeMode` and the `darkTheme`/`lightTheme` functions. It renders a toggle switch that, when interacted with, calls the appropriate theme function to update the global state.

5.  **`Card` Component (`components/Card.jsx`):**
    This component also consumes the `ThemeContext` to reactively apply styling based on the `themeMode`. Tailwind CSS classes with the `dark:` prefix are used to define styles that only apply when the `dark` class is present on the `<html>` element (e.g., `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`).

# üí∞ Currency Converter

A user-friendly web application for converting currencies in real-time. This project demonstrates fetching exchange rates from an external API, dynamic UI updates, and robust error handling.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-time Exchange Rates:** Fetches up-to-date currency exchange rates from a reliable API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API, Open Exchange Rates).
* **Intuitive User Interface:** Clean and easy-to-use interface for selecting currencies and entering amounts.
* **Dynamic Conversion:** Instantly displays converted amounts as you type or select currencies.
* **Currency Dropdowns:** Populated dynamically with a comprehensive list of world currencies.
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles API errors or network issues.
* **Responsive Design:** Works well on various screen sizes.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **React.js:** For building the interactive UI.
* **[Your CSS Framework/Library, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, plain CSS Modules]:** For styling the application.
* **Fetch API / Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the currency exchange rate API.
* **[Name of Currency API, e.g., ExchangeRate-API.com]:** The external service providing exchange rates.

## üìÅ Project Structure

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **API Integration:** The application makes a call to a currency exchange rate API to fetch the latest rates based on a selected base currency.
2.  **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage the input amount, selected `from` and `to` currencies, and the conversion result.
3.  **Dynamic Updates:** When the amount or selected currencies change, a re-calculation is triggered, and the UI updates to show the new converted value.
4.  **User Experience:** Clear input fields, dropdowns for currency selection, and immediate feedback provide a smooth conversion experience.

## üîë API Key (Important!)

This project relies on an external API for currency exchange rates. You will need to obtain your own API key and configure it in the application.

1.  **Sign up** at [Link to API Website, e.g., ExchangeRate-API.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
2.  **Get your API Key.**
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project (if not already present).
4.  **Add your API key** to the `.env` file like this:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    *(Note: The `VITE_` prefix is common for Vite projects. Adjust if using Create React App or Webpack.)*
